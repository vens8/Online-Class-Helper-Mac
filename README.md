# Online-Class-Helper-for-Mac
Attend online classes with one click!

OCH - Online Class Helper is a tool made for students attending online classes which allows them to join and attend their classes hassle-free with a single click. Unable to organize all your class links throughout your week? Add your classes once they're organized and tabulated. You can also make and share templates with your friends which can save them time.

# Features
- Organized Classes

- Easily add, edit or delete classes

- Make, share and load templates

# Installation

- Download and run the OCH.zip file.

- Extract the zip file and run OCH.app
  
  If your device prompts you that you cannot open the application, it's because you have third party applications permissions turned off. So, go to System Preferenes > Security & Privacy and click on 'Open anyway'.
  
- If running the app shows you an error (for eg. Online Class Error: Open Console / Terminate) and doesn't open the app, this is because OCH for Mac is an early release and cannot be run directly yet. However to use OCH for Mac, simply follow the following steps:

  - Right click OCH.app and click on "Open package contents"
  - Go to Contents > MacOS
  - Open the OCH (exec) file and you're good to go.
 
  Sorry for the inconvenience, it will be fixed as soon as possible for the next update.

- Set up your classes by going to the Add/Edit classes tab. You can also load a .dat/.txt template using the 'load file' button. So you can make and share templates of your classes with each other! 

  Note: Manually modified files won't work as they should be binary files and must be generated through OCH.

- You're done! Head back to the main page and you will find your class details at the corresponding time. Good luck, and happy learning!

# Note
Do not modify/delete any of the files in the root directory or it will result in the malfunctioning or improper loading of the program
