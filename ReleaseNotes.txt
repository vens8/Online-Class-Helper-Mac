[Updates for OCH 1.1.0]

- Added a settings menu that allows users to make some customizations.
- Added the notification service that notifies (and launches the class automatically on demand) you at/before class time.
- Users can choose whether they wanted to be prompted for updates on startup.
- Option to choose what day is the first day of the user's week.
- OCH now only loads valid data files to prevent crashing [Fixed minor errors regarding the same].
- Quickly close OCH with a shortcut key (Ctrl + W).
- OCH loads and opens up much faster now.
- You can now send anonymous suggestions/feedback from the Send Feedback menu so we can improve your experience with OCH.
- Fixed issues with updating OCH.
- Resolved minor bugs and loopholes.

[Note]

Notifications/launch currently don't work if OCH is closed. This feature will be added in the next update. On Mac, however, you can hide OCH to make it run 
in the background to receive notification.
